# Day 11 – Design Patterns

**Date:** 2025-09-08  

## What I Learned
- Understanding why design patterns are important for writing reusable, maintainable, and scalable code.
- Explored three common design patterns in Python:
  1. **Singleton** – Ensure only one instance of a class exists.
  2. **Factory Method** – Create objects without specifying exact classes.
  3. **Observer** – Establish a publish/subscribe mechanism for communication between objects.

## Files
- `singleton.py` → Example of Singleton using a metaclass for database connection.
- `factory.py` → Factory Method for creating different button objects depending on OS type.
- `observer.py` → Observer pattern where multiple users subscribe to a subject.

## How to Run
Run each file individually:
```bash
python singleton.py
python factory.py
python observer.py
