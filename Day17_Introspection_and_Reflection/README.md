# Day 17 – Concurrency in Python

**Date:** 2025-09-14  

## What I Learned
- The difference between **threading, asyncio, and multiprocessing** in Python.
- How concurrency improves responsiveness and throughput for I/O-bound tasks.
- That CPU-bound tasks benefit more from multiprocessing than threads.

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented threading example with multiple workers.
- Wrote asyncio tasks using `async` / `await`.
- Demonstrated multiprocessing with parallel processes.

## Files
- `main.py` → Contains threading, asyncio, and multiprocessing examples.

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
