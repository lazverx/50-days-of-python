# Day 13 – Mixins and Inheritance

**Date:** 2025-09-10  

## What I Learned
- The concept of **mixins** as lightweight classes that provide reusable behavior.
- How to combine **inheritance** with mixins to enrich base classes without deep hierarchies.
- How mixins promote **code reuse** and separation of concerns.

## Tasks Completed
- Created `LoggerMixin` to add logging functionality.
- Created `TimestampMixin` to track `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- Combined mixins with a `BaseUser` class to build a `User` class with extra behaviors.

## Files
- `mixins.py` → Mixins and User class example.

## How to Run
```bash
python mixins.py
