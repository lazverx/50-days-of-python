# Day 4 â€“ Iterators & Generators

**Date:** 2025-09-02  

## What I Learned
- The concept of **iterables** vs **iterators**.  
- How the **iterator protocol** works using `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.  
- Writing a **custom iterator class** to generate sequences.  
- Creating **generator functions** with `yield`.  
- Using generators for efficient memory usage and infinite sequences.  

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented a custom iterator that returns square numbers.  
- Wrote a generator function for Fibonacci numbers.  
- Practiced consuming generators with `next()` and `for` loops.  
- Implemented an infinite counter generator.  

## Files
- `itergener.py`  
- `README.md`
