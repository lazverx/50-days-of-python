# Day 22 – Multiprocessing and Shared Memory

**Date:** 2025-09-19  

## What I Learned
- How to run multiple processes using Python’s `multiprocessing` module.
- Using `Value` and `Array` for **shared memory** across processes.
- Synchronizing access with `Lock` to prevent race conditions.
- Using `Manager().dict()` for sharing mutable data structures across processes.

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented a shared counter incremented by 4 worker processes.
- Filled a shared array with values using a separate process.
- Demonstrated inter-process communication with a managed dictionary.

## Files
- `main.py`
