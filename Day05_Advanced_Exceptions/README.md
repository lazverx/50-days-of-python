# Day 5 â€“ Advanced Exception Handling

**Date:** 2025-09-02  

## What I Learned
- Difference between **built-in exceptions** and **custom exceptions**.  
- Raising exceptions with `raise` and chaining exceptions using `from`.  
- Using `try / except / else / finally` blocks effectively.  
- Writing **custom exception classes** by extending `Exception`.  
- Handling multiple exception types in one block.  
- Using exceptions in **context managers (`with`)** for resource handling.  

## Tasks Completed
- Created custom exceptions (`InvalidAgeError`, `NegativeNumberError`).  
- Practiced exception chaining (`raise ... from ...`).  
- Used `try/except/else/finally` to handle file operations safely.  
- Implemented a small program with robust error handling and custom messages.
