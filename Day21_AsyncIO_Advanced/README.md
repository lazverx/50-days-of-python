# Day 21 – Advanced AsyncIO

**Date:** 2025-09-18  

## What I Learned
- Advanced use of Python’s `asyncio` library.
- Running multiple coroutines concurrently with `asyncio.gather`.
- Creating and using **async context managers** (`async with`).
- Building **async generators** (`async def ... yield`).
- Structuring realistic async workflows (downloads + logging + streaming).

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented simulated file downloads running in parallel.
- Used an async context manager to manage a fake database connection.
- Created an async generator to stream chunks of data.
- Logged events asynchronously.

## Files
- `main.py`
