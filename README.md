# 🐍 50 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my **50 Days of Python Challenge**, where I commit to exploring Python every day for 50 days.  
The focus is on **intermediate to advanced Python concepts**, covering object-oriented programming, design patterns, concurrency, performance optimization, and more.

This repository serves as a personal roadmap to strengthen my understanding of Python and to build a solid foundation for solving real-world problems.
