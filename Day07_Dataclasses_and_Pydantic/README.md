# Day 7 – Data Classes & Pydantic

**Date:** 2025-09-04  

## What I Learned
- How to use `@dataclass` for cleaner and more structured data models.  
- Adding default values and type hints inside dataclasses.  
- Using methods inside dataclasses to add behavior.  
- Introduction to **Pydantic** for advanced validation.  
- Automatic type coercion and validation errors with Pydantic models.  
- Differences:  
  - `dataclasses` → simple, lightweight, built-in.  
  - `Pydantic` → validation, parsing, strict typing (great for APIs).  

## Tasks Completed
- Created simple `@dataclass` for representing a Book.  
- Added methods to compute values inside a dataclass.  
- Built a `UserModel` with Pydantic and tested validation.  
- Compared dataclass and Pydantic usage.  

## Files
- `dataclasses.py`
