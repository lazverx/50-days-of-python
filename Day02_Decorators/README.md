# 📘 Day 2 – Decorators in Python

**📅 Date:** 2025-08-30  

---

## 📖 What I Learned
- How decorators wrap functions to extend behavior  
- Using `functools.wraps` to preserve function metadata  
- Creating **parameterized decorators** (decorators with arguments)  
- Implementing **class-based decorators** with `__call__`  
- Practical uses: logging, repetition, and performance timing  

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Created `/Day02_Decorators` folder  
- Wrote `decorators.py` with function, argument, and class-based decorators  
- Verified logging, repetition, and timing output

## 📂 Files in This Day
- `decorators.py` → Python code with multiple decorator examples  
- `README.md` → Documentation and learning notes
