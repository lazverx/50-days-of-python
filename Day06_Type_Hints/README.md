# Day 6 â€“ Type Hints in Python

**Date:** 2025-09-03  

## What I Learned
- Basics of **type annotations** for variables and functions.  
- Using built-in types (`int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`) in annotations.  
- Advanced typing with `Optional`, `Union`, and `Any`.  
- Using `List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`, and `Set` from `typing`.  
- Creating **type aliases** for cleaner code.  
- Benefits of type hints: readability, tooling support, and static analysis with `mypy`.  

## Tasks Completed
- Annotated functions with explicit type hints.  
- Used `Optional` and `Union` to handle flexible inputs.  
- Created a custom type alias for readability.  
- Ran a sample `mypy` check for static type validation.
