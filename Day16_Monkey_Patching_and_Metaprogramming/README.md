# Day 16 – Monkey Patching & Metaprogramming

**Date:** 2025-09-13  

## What I Learned
- **Monkey Patching**: modifying methods or attributes of classes at runtime.
- **Metaprogramming**: writing code that generates or modifies other code dynamically.
- How Python allows flexible runtime behavior.

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented a `MathOps` class and changed its behavior with monkey patching.
- Created a `DynamicClass` using `type()` and attached methods dynamically.
- Patched a `Service` class method at runtime to simulate interception.

## Files
- `main.py` → Contains monkey patching and metaprogramming examples.

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
