# Day 10 â€“ Enums and Attributes

**Date:** 2025-09-07  

## What I Learned
- How to define and use Python `Enum` for symbolic names.  
- Difference between `Enum`, `IntEnum`, and `auto()`.  
- Accessing enum values and comparing them safely.  
- Using attributes in classes:
  - **Instance attributes** (unique per object).
  - **Class attributes** (shared across all objects).  
- Good practices for organizing constants with Enums instead of raw strings/integers.  

## Tasks Completed
- Created a `Color` enum with custom values.  
- Demonstrated `auto()` in enums.  
- Compared instance attributes vs class attributes.  
- Tested enum comparisons and dictionary mapping with enums.  

## Files
- `enumsattribute.py`
